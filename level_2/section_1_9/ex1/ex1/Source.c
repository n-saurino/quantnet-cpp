/*
Create a C-program that reads the characters from the keyboard and shows them on
screen (the inputted characters should only be displayed when the user hits 'enter', line
by line).

When ^A is entered, the program must end properly. Then the following message will
appear: �CTRL + A is a correct ending.�

Tip: getchar() reads and putchar() writes the type int. The value of ^A is 1
